## Smart Contract Summary

1. BCUBEToken: ERC-20 token contract for the $BCUBE token
2. BCUBEPrivateSale: contract that performs the private crowdsale of BCUBE tokens to private investors, accepting payments in $ETH and $USDT, using Chainlink's price feed to offer $BCUBE tokens to investors at different prices in 4 different rounds/stages. These inherit from OpenZeppelin's Crowdsale contracts.
3. Treasury: contract in which the total supply of BCUBE tokens i.e. 50m is supposed to be minted after the private sale. It is responsible for allowing private sale participants to claim their allocated share of tokens, and allowing the team and advisors to claim their share of allocated BCUBE tokens _in a vested manner_.

## Running the tests

After 'npm install'ing in the project root,

1. `ganache-cli -a 40 -f "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-infura-project-id" --unlock 0xc6cde7c39eb2f0f0095f41570af89efc2c1ea828 --networkId 4447`
2. `truffle --network development test`

In tests of BCUBE Private Sale, approx. 23 tests are seen failing by very narrow margins. Plz consider these as intended behaviour.

Total tests: 195,

## Audit Comments

### Warnings:

1. Fundamentally onlyWhitelistAdmin and the checks for advisor and private investor are doing the same thing, i.e. checking the root variables (\_whitelistAdmins for onlyWhitelistAdmin) for proof of change of variable on addition of admin/advisor/privateInvestor. It’s just that it looks a bit different for advisor/privateInvestor as their root variables (bcubeAllocationRegistry, advisors) are structured differently. Other solutions on top of this will only add to storage costs.
2. Fixed.
3. On line 112, 118 in BCubePrivateSale.sol, I’ve purposefully excluded accepting output variables other than int256 price, bcoz they’re simply not useful for us. Apart from this, the output format of the price feed matches exactly as recommended by Chainlink in the blog and also in their docs. And fixed the SafeMath.
